  slug: book-cover
  description: I was asked by Brockett Horne to do a fictional for the book How To Be a Graphic Designer Without Losing Your Soul, by Adrian Shaughnessy. The twist, one cover was supposed to showcase 'good design' and the other, 'bad design'. Honestly, I think both of them are great.

  description: This is a project I worked on for a while. It is the album cover for local Virginia rapper, CL8 THE CR8. I worked hard to make something as bold as Cl8s lyrics. After various revisions I was able to create something that we both really like.

- title: Story Writr Mobile App
  slug: story-writr
  description: Storywritr is a fictional collaborative story writing app concept. The app was presented to me by Instructor Mark Sanders. I was given the name and concept, the design was up to me. I choose to use color as a function rather than just a decoration. When a user joins a story and add their first sentence they are given a random color. This allow the story to read in paragraph form yet still allow individuals users to stand apart.

- title: Iteractive Poster
  slug: interactive-poster
  description: When I found out how many people in Baltimore are heroin users I was shocked. I decided to create a poster to inform people, and also make them think. Instead of just telling people the alarming number I choose to slow down the process and pose it in the form for a question. When the viewer scans the QR codes they are presented with more information. Sadly the correct answer is 45,000. (Sidenote, at the time this was made QR codes were having their moment)
